%%  Description: this software applies algorithms to segment fission-tracks 
%% in crystal images by optical microscopy, based on starlets. 
%% Automatization of these algorithms is given using Matthews Correlation 
%% Coefficient (MCC). The difference between an image and its Ground 
%% Truth is given by a colored comparison.

%%	How to: in Matlab/Octave prompt, type:
%% [D,L,COMP,MCC] = main(IMG,IMGGT);
%% where img is the input image and IMGGT is its ground truth.
%% This command asks the desired algorithm application level and returns
%% starlet detail decomposition levels (D), algorithm output related to 
%% each starlet decomposition level (R), comparison between IMG and 
%% IMGGT for each starlet decomposition level (COMP) and Matthews 
%% Correlation Coefficient for IMG and IMGGT in each level (MCC).

%%	Required files: main.m, binarize.m, confusionmatrix.m, mattewscc.m, 
%% starlet.m, twodimfilt.m, xtracttracks.m
