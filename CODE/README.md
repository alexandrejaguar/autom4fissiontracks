**Description:** this software applies algorithms to segment fission-tracks in crystal images by optical microscopy, based on starlets. Automatization of these algorithms is given using Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The difference between an image and its Ground Truth is given by a colored comparison.

**How to:** in Matlab/Octave prompt, type:

`[D,L,COMP,MCC] = main(IMG, IMGGT);`

Where `IMG` is the input image and `IMGGT` is its ground truth.
This command asks the desired algorithm application level and returns starlet detail decomposition levels (`D`), algorithm output related to each starlet decomposition level (`R`), comparison between `IMG` and `IMGGT` for each starlet decomposition level (`COMP`) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient for `IMG` and `IMGGT` in each level (`MCC`).

**Required files:** `main.m`, `binarize.m`, `confusionmatrix.m`, `mattewscc.m,` `starlet.m`, `twodimfilt.m`, `xtracttracks.m`
